Unlock the Mac Experience on Your HP EliteDesk!

This hackintosh configuration is designed to bring the best of both worlds: the power and reliability of your HP EliteDesk and the intuitive user experience of macOS.

Specifically optimized for HP EliteDesk 800 G4 and G5 DM 35W/65W models, this setup can also be adapted to various Series 800 G4, G5, and SFF models with CoffeeLake (CFL) and CoffeeLake Refresh (CFLR) processors.
