## Update Sonoma 14.7

- Sonoma 14.7 upgrade applied without any issues.  This hack is working perfectly.
- SBM Disabled

## Sequoia 15.0

- Ethernet connectivity issue (Ethernet connection problem only on Remote Desktop)
  - Try to de-activate and then re-activate Ethernet in System Settings
  - Unplugging the RJ-45 connector and then plugging it back in also works
  - I didn't encounter any Ethernet problems with other applications
  - Wifi,Bluetooth OK
    
- I'm staying with Sonoma 14.7 (where the Ethernet problem does not occur on Remote Desktop)
